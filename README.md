# RL_Ion_gates
Source code for: "Hybrid discrete-continuous compilation of trapped-ion quantum circuits with deep reinforcement learning"

# Requirements
See file requirements.txt

# Data 
Datafiles are available on Zenodo: 

# Use
Run gate_sim.py for compilation of general gates. Some are available, custom gates need to be defined in the same file.
The same goes for states. The file simulate_ham_unitary.py can run the simulation of the XXZ model.
